  If presented with the question: Create a function that takes an input and returns a reversed string... there are
  various ways to tackle this question. The real question is which answer to the question is the most efficient?

  Performance Matters

  A simple question like reversing a string may not matter, but when you have hundreds of pieces of data, simplifying
  code could save hours. Having long repetitive/insufficient code could slow down or crash your computer. With that
  being said, it is also important to be able to articulate how Big O Notation works.

  Let's start with an example

  <!-- insert add up to function image -->

  Both of the funcitons produce the same result, therefore, which one is better and what does better mean?

  The answer depends on the situation but most people would agree that better means faster and less memory intensive. So
  let's compare the two functions and see how long it takes to log 1 billion to the console.

  <!-- Insert snippets -->

  The times vary slightly each time you run the function, but you can see that the shorter function that does not run a
  for loop is taking a fraction of the time to run. However, I only showed you how long the equation takes on my
  machine... it could be much different on another person's computer - I mean, even on my computer, the times changed
  each time I called function. So timing functions like this is not very reliable, because the timer is not precise
  enough. Let's get into how Big O Notation can help us be more precise.

  Instead of printing out how many seconds it took, we are able to count the number of simple operations the computer
  has to perform. The efficiency is this increases due to the fact that it does not matter which computer we are using.
  In the second function, there were three operations performed: multiplication, addition and division. No matter what
  number is plugged in, (1 or 10 billion) there will only be three operations. In comparison to
  the first function that contains the for loop, the operations depend on what number is plugged into the function. If 1
  is plugged into the function it will run an addition operation 1 time, if 1 billion is plugged into <i>n</i>, it
  performs the addition 1 billion times.


  Algorithms will satisfy the Big O Notation if the number of simple operations the computer has to do is eventually
  less than a constant, times the function of "n", as "n" increases.
